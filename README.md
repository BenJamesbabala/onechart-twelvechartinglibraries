# onechart-twelvechartinglibraries

The code for twelve charting libraries which I tried for my blogpost ["One Chart, Twelve Charting Libraries"](http://lisacharlotterost.github.io/2016/05/17/one-chart-code/)

Excerpt from the blog post: "Charting Libraries. Gosh, there are so many out there. On [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_JavaScript_charting_frameworks) [and other websites](http://socialcompare.com/en/comparison/javascript-graphs-and-charts-libraries), one can find a comparison of ca. 50 libraries  - and these are only JavaScript libraries; not mentioning languages like Processing and libraries for Python and R. In the following blog post, I will try to get to know a few ones out of the great sea of possibilities. I want to understand their differences and how easy it is to learn them. To do so, **I recreated the same bubble chart with twelve different frameworks**. The chart and the underlying dataset I'll use for that experiment are explained in the last post, ["One Chart, Twelve Tools"](http://lisacharlotterost.github.io/2016/05/17/one-chart-tools/)."

I'm fairly new to most of these libraries. If there's a better way to create the bubble chart than the one I used, please let me know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lisacrost) or via email (lisacharlotterost@gmail.com)!
